# Introduction #

Programming for me is a hobby:
- It cost nothing, just my time
- You can create anything you want
- You can share it with everyone in the world
- You can earn a lot of money

There are many programming languages. They are all different, but they also have many things in common.

You will eventually have to pick a programming language - one that you want to become good at! But for a start, you can really use any language as the same principals apply to them all. Once you know the basics, you will also know more of what you want to do and then you will know also what to look for when picking a language. In time, every good programmer will learn a few languages.

I am going to start you off in __Python__. I don't even like Python, but:
- it's an easy language to learn,
- it is used in many web sites and mobile applications, which most of you want to build,
- many many companies use it and pay a lot of money for programmers who can write Python, in case you consider making this a job,
- it is free (as mostly all other languages are too)

You need nothing to start with, except a computer and an Internet connection - which you have, else you would not be reading this!

For a start, you can even learn on your mobile phone or tablet. Soon you will want a keyboard... but start at least!

Programming does not require a fast connection or a lot of data. If you looked at one phone on WhatsApp, you already used more data than what you would need to do basic programming!

You will only need a bit of data if you want to watch my videos, or install a programming language, or when you eventually start building real web sites and real mobile apps. For now, very little data is required.
