# Learn to Program #

## Welcome ##
Learn to program for the first time - no previous experience required!

* If you passed grade 6 or 7 at school with good marks, you are ready to program!
* If you are a bit older, it will just be easier!
* If you are much older, it may become difficult again - sorry :-)

If you are taking Programming or Computer Technologies at school, you can also do this. Even if you learn another language at school, this course will just help you understand the basics even better and will not confuse you. If it does, just stop, but I am sure it won't.

The more you program, the easier it gets!

**Practice! Practice! Practice!**
